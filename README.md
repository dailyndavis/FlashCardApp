# FlashCardApp

Hello! :) 
I created this Flashcard app as part of the Udemy 100 Days of Python course to get more familiar with the Pandas library and Tkinter. 
I used to study French, and thought this would be a fun way to keep practicing. 
Feel free to download/use this, or let me know if you noticed any improvements. Thanks for stopping by!
